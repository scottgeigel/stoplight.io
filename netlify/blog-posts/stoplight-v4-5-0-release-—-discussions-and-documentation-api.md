## New üöÄ

### [Organizations](http://docs.stoplight.io/platform/projects/discussions)

Discussions allow organizations to track and share conversations at the project and/or file level. They are particularly useful for tracking enhancements, bugs, issues, and tasks. Discussions are displayed in a Projects Home and within the Discussions toolbar. They are sorted by most recent activity.

*Discussions Example*

### [Hubs](https://docs.stoplight.io/api-reference/documentation)

Stoplight exposes an API that enables you to programmatically publish and unpublish documentation, download build zips, and modify a docs configuration. Additionally, you can retrieve a documents build list and configuration. This enables more advanced automation and integrations into existing workflows. For example, continuous integrations services such as Travis, Jenkins, and Circle CI.
