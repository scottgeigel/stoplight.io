## New ðŸš€

* **[Fair Use Billing](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/getting-started/billing)**: Our paid plans now only count active members that have created a project or updated project files in the past 30 days. This better aligns cost to value, and results in a lower bill in all cases. Now your members will only be added to your bill if and when they start creating content on Stoplight. Unleash your Engineers!

* **[Annual Billing](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/getting-started/billing)**: Save up to 20%

* **[Magic Invite Links](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/organizations/invite-people)**: Share it via email, Slack, and other channels to easily onboard members in your organization. Fair use billing means they wonâ€™t count until they actually start creating content. Abra Kadabra.

![Custom CSS](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1J5Ndy3hDPJxnzd0bWd62w.png)
*Custom CSS*

* **[Custom CSS](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/design/custom-css)**: Add some custom style and flair to your documentation with Custom CSS.

* **Custom HTML Landing Pages**: Create beautiful custom landing pages to greet and direct your users.

* **[OAuth2 Token Generation in *Hubâ€™s* Try it Out](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/oauth-hubs)***: *If* *your API is protected by OAuth2, you can now generate tokens to enable Try it Out block.

## Enhancements ðŸ’ª

* **Relative $refs:** References from one file to another in the same project are now represented with relative URLs. For example, `./models/user.json` instead of `[https://exporter.stoplight.io/45/master/models/user.json](https://exporter.stoplight.io/45/master/models/user.json)`. This has a number of benefits, such as increased portability. It also sets the stage for better desktop local file editing and versioning.

* **Published Hubs now support Internet Explorer 11**

Please reach out via chat or support@stoplight.io if you have any questions about the above changes.
